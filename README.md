# Overall project requirements
- Graph read module
- Get walks module
- Combine walks to cycles module
- Prune cycles module
- Validate cycles module.

# Possible improvements
- Parallelisation of getwalks and/or combine walk to cycles and/or prune cycles.
- Smart way to determine which walks are necessary for the fasted combination of walks to form the k-cycle.
- Look into memory usage and loading/offloading.
