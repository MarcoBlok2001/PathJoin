Experiment 1: Pathjoin performance comparison
2 plots: x-axis = cycle length, y-axis is time taken
1 plot for undirected graphs and 1 for directed graphs.

Multiple lines for 2-join 3-join 4-join

Most optimal split is used with descending order.

for 7-cycles with 4 join: 2 2 2 1
for 7-cycles with 3 join: 3 2 2
for 7-cycles with 2 join: 4 3
